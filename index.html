    <h3> About</h3>
        <p class='about'>I am a journalist, a music enthusiast, and an amateur coder.</p>

        <p class='about'>Building on tools and methods to understand how people use and consume information in their daily lives, I design media products and services. </p>

        <p class='about'>I currently manage the Design Thinking program at the media startup <a href=''>First Look Media</a>. I joined the company after an amazing experience as a <a href='http://knight.stanford.edu/journalism-challenges/2014/the-page-one-project-summary/'>JSK fellow</a> at Stanford University, where I followed a multidisciplinary curriculum involving design thinking and computer science, and did in-depth research and prototyping on new interfaces to access, curate and share information. </p>

        <p class='about'>Prior to Stanford, I was a member of the team launching the mapping startup <a href='http://cartodb.com/'>CartoDB</a>, and a co-founder of the media non-profit organization <a href='http://porcausa.org/'>porCausa</a>. I also worked for 11 years as a news reporter and editor at Spanish newspaper <a href='http://www.elmundo.es/'>El Mundo</a>, where I helped grow its digital edition and traveled throughout East Africa and East Asia as a reporter. I also spent three years working in cancer biotech. </p>

        <p class='about'>Besides my work as a journalist, I'm a <a href='http://dschool.stanford.edu/bio/carlos-martinez-de-la-serna/'>guest lecturer</a> at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford, and I've taught full courses on digital journalism, mapping and data visualization at universities in Spain, US and Colombia. </p>

        <p class='about'>I grew up in Madrid during the 80s â€”a time wonderfully portraited in this <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088461/'>movie</a>. For the last 20 years, I've lived in Spain, Holland, Japan and in both coasts of the US. I currently live in Palo Alto, California, with my wife and our two kids. </p>
